## Squirrel Tracker Project
### Description
We used Django to build a web application that helps you to keep track of all known squirrels in Central Park.
Dataset was obtained from [**2018 Central Park Squirrel Census**](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2018-Central-Park-Squirrel-Census-Squirrel-Data/vfnx-vebw). 
For the styling of the website, we used Bootstrap4. 

Our website provides the following views:
- [Map] displays the locations of all squirrel sightings
- [Sightings] shows a list of all sightings 
  - You can also update a particular sighting by clicking on any of the squirrel ids.
- [Add] allows you to add a new sighting
- [Stats] shows some quick statistics about the dataset
